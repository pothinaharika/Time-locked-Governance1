# Time-locked Governance

## Project Description

A decentralized governance smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that implements mandatory waiting periods for all governance proposals. This system ensures thoughtful decision-making by requiring a time delay between proposal creation and execution, preventing hasty or impulsive governance actions while maintaining transparency and democratic participation.

## Project Vision

To create a robust and secure governance framework that promotes deliberative democracy in decentralized organizations. By implementing time-locked mechanisms, we aim to:

- **Enhance Security**: Prevent malicious or rushed proposals from being executed immediately
- **Promote Thoughtful Governance**: Allow community members adequate time to review and discuss proposals
- **Build Trust**: Create transparent and predictable governance processes
- **Foster Community Engagement**: Encourage broader participation in governance decisions
- **Establish Standards**: Set a foundation for responsible decentralized governance practices

## Key Features

### üîí **Mandatory Time Locks**
- All proposals must wait for a predetermined period before execution
- Customizable waiting periods based on proposal importance
- Immutable time constraints once proposals are created

### üìù **Proposal Management**
- Create detailed governance proposals with descriptions
- Unique proposal identification system
- Track proposal status and execution history

### üïê **Time-based Security**
- Utilizes Aptos framework timestamp functionality
- Prevents premature proposal execution
- Automatic validation of waiting periods

### üë• **Multi-stakeholder Participation**
- Any authorized user can create proposals
